An example, you may want to replace any FileSize appears in your program into LastModifiedTime. Since it appears everywhere as both uppercases and lowercases, you have to write it several times:

  :%s/FileSize/LastModifiedTime/g      " function names
  :%s/file_size/last_modified_time/g   " variable names
  :%s/FILE_SIZE/LAST_MODIFIED_TIME/g   " macros
  :%s/File size/Last modified time/g   " document/comments
  ......

This script copes with the case style for you so that you need write just one command:

  :%s/file\A\?size/\=SmartCase("LastModifiedTime")/ig

An alternative way:
  first search for the string:  /\cfile\A\?size
  then run a command:  :%SmartCase "LastModifiedTime"

By the way, SmartCase can also cope with the circumstance where you want to replace the string's case style while keeping its words. For example:
  FileSize => file_size
  LastModifiedTime => last_modified_time
  ......
This can be done with the following command:

  :%s/\(\u\l\+\)\{2,}/\=SmartCase(0,"reference_style")/g

To sum up: the first argument to SmartCase is the reference words, the secend argument is the reference styles, if the second argument omitted, it's submatch(0).
